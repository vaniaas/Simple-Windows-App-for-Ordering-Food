# Simple-Windows-App-for-Ordering-Food
This Windows application for ordering food has several simple functions such as: calculating the total price that needs to be paid, using promo codes to get discounts, and displaying receipts. I use the sample menu and prices from Bakmi GM 2017.

Lang : Bahasa

How to run :
1. Open "Bakmi GM-X5-32" folder
2. Open "bin" folder
3. Open "Debug" folder
4. Open "Bakmi GM-X5-32" application 

Note : 
- If the application interface doesn't run well, try to install the fonts contained in the "additional fonts" folder.
- If you want to use a promo code, the promo code is "HEMAT".
